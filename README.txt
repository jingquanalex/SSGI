Dear Alex,

Please feel free to use this repository for any sources, paper sources, etc., relating to your project.

Any larger datasets, however, should be stored on our UCL filestore; I created the following directory for your use:

   /cs/research/vr/twdata0/data/msc/2017/jzhang

I strongly recommend familiarising yourself with rsync. (The man page of that command is extensive, but definitely worth the read.)

Best
-Tim
